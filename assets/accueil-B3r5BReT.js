It targets the transverse abdominis, a deep muscle that acts as a natural corset, to strengthen core support without excessively engaging the abdominal muscles. This gentle yet effective approach promotes deep breathing and harmony between body and mind, physically and mentally preparing women for childbirth. Additionally, prenatal Pilates helps manage the emotional fluctuations common during this period, strengthening resilience and overall well-being."},{question:"What is Gyrotonic?",answer:"Gyrotonic is a physical training method inspired by Pilates, yoga, dance, tai-chi, and swimming. It is distinguished by its fluid, circular, and spiral movements that stretch and strengthen muscles while improving flexibility and joint mobility. This practice is performed using specific equipment with pulleys and cranks for adapted resistance, allowing harmonious integration of body and mind. Gyrotonic thus offers a complete experience that promotes overall physical well-being."},{question:"What are the benefits of Postnatal Pilates?",answer:"After childbirth, postnatal Pilates offers numerous benefits for new mothers. This gentle and adapted method:<ul><li>·       Targets muscles used during pregnancy.</li><li>·       Strengthens the pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles.</li><li>·       Improves blood circulation.</li><li>·       Promotes relaxation and deep stretching. In summary, postnatal Pilates is a valuable ally for regaining shape, balance, and vitality after baby's birth</li></ul>"},{question:"What is the STOTT PILATES method?",answer:"The STOTT PILATES method is a modern and comprehensive approach to Pilates, focused on safety, effectiveness, and body awareness. It is much more than just a physical workout; it's a holistic approach that takes into account anatomy, breathing, and movement quality for overall well-being."}]},d={hero:e,intro:t,services:i,formations:o,engagement:n,temoignages:a,callToAction:s,blog:r,images:l,faqs:c};export{r as blog,s as callToAction,d as default,n as engagement,c as faqs,o as formations,e as hero,l as images,t as intro,i as services,a as temoignages};
